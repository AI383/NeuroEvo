# Neuroevolution (http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuroevolution) 

## Basic Algorithms

### Terminology
> Genotype - encoding of a population member
> Phenotype - encoding of a neural network
> Neuroevolution -  is a machine learning technique that applies evolutionary algorithms to construct artificial neural networks, taking inspiration from the evolution of biological nervous systems in nature

### Differences to other NN learning methods
> highly general
> allows learning without explicit targets
> only sparse feedback
> allows arbitrary neural models and network structures
> Allows learning even when correct output may not be known

### Common Artificial Neural Network 
> Operate through supervised learning
> Depend upon a set of input-output pairs  

### Neuroevolution uses
> reinforcement learning
> evolutionary robotics
> artificial life

### Neuroevolution Algorithm
1. Each genotype is mapped to a phenotype
2. These phenotypes are then employed in a task
3. After which performance is then measured
4. This performance then signifies a Fitness
5. After all members are evaluated, genetic operators produce next population

## Neural Network Encodings

### Conventional Neuroevolution Approach (CNE) 
> Encoding formed by concatenating the numerical values	for the network weights
> Allows the evolution to optimize the weights of a fixed neural network architecture

### CNE Downsides 
> Can converge to local phenomena 
> Requires experimenters to choose an appropiately sized and structured network topology
> Scales poorly to more difficult problems because the number of parameters to be evolved grows linearly or quadratically in the size of the network

### Solution Components Approach (SC)
> Instead of population of complete neural networks, a population of network fragments, neurons, or connection weights are evolved 
> Each individual is evaluated as one part of a full network 
> Its fitness reflects how well it cooperates with other individuals in the particular solution 
> ADVANTAGE: complex problem is broken into several smaller subproblems

### Topology Evolution Approach (TE)
> Choosing an appropiate topology is difficult
>> yet has a large effect on the experimental outcome 
> Evolving topologies can achieve better performance than evolving weights only

### Direct Encoding
> CNE, SC, TE
> Each part of the encoding corresponds to one part of the network, and vice versa

### Indirect Encoding
> Specifies a process through which the network is constructed
>> examples: cell division, spatial embedding, or generation through expanding grammatical rules
> can be highly compact (i.e. a large number of connections can be encoded with few parameters) 
> takes advantage of modular solutions
>> Modularity implies that the same structures can be repeated with minor modifications

## Open Research Challenges
> creating effective and scalable indirect encodings
> understanding and synthesizing the evolutionary pressures leading to high-level intelligence 
> scaling neuroevolution to evolve cognitive behaviors 
>> examples: multimodal behavior, communication, and lifetime learning
